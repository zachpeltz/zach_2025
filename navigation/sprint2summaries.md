CSP Big Ideas: Iterations!
Introduction
The purpose of loops or iterations in Python is to code repetitive tasks, which is fundamental in programming. Weâ€™ll go over:

For Loops

Used when you know how many times you need to run an algorithm.
Runs through a specific set of instructions and then stops.
While Loops / Do-While Loops

Similar to For loops but with conditions at the end.
Example: Do something 3 times, but IF it fails on the 3rd, redo instructions again.
Index Loops

Used to control the number of iterations in a single loop.
Continue and Break

Commands that help to terminate certain loops or move on to the next loop.

3.10 Lists Summary
List Operations
Assigning Values: Assign specific values to elements in a list.
Inserting Elements: Insert elements at designated positions within a list.
Appending Elements: Add new elements to the end of the list.
Removing Elements: Remove elements from the list using methods like .pop().
Calculating Length: Determine the total number of elements in a list using functions like len().
Pseudocode for Sum of Even Numbers
Variables: Define variables necessary for calculations.
Create Number List: Initialize a list of numbers.
Modulus Operator: Use the modulus operator (%) to identify even numbers.
Control Structures: Implement loops and conditionals to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of even numbers.
Functions and List Hacks
Finding Max and Min: Create functions to identify the largest and smallest numbers in a list.
Iteration: Use loops to process each element in the list efficiently.
User Input: Collect user input to populate lists and manipulate their elements.
Summing List Elements: Implement functionality to sum numbers in the list.
Removing Elements: Allow users to remove the last element using the .pop() method.
Additional Hacks
Sum of Even Numbers: Write code that creates a list of numbers 1 through 100 and calculates the sum of all even numbers.
Task List Generator: Create a list by taking user input, and display the tasks entered for tracking purposes.
