    "Using programs with data is often focused on SQL and database actions. Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the foundation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This blog focuses on SQLAlchemy and an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style. SQLAlchemy is a powerful SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. It allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects, making database operations more intuitive and easier to manage.\n",

    "### How does a database meet College Board requirements?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Program Usage**: Applications should have an \"iterative and interactive way when processing information\".\n",
    "- **Managing Data**: In general, \"classifying data are part of the process in using programs\". Often examples talk of \"data files in a Table\".\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Programs show that \"insight and knowledge can be obtained from ... digitally represented information\".\n",
    "- **Filtering Systems**: Develop \"tools for finding information and recognizing patterns\".\n",
    "- **Application**: In a sample program, it discusses that \"the preserve has two databases\". Another example says \"an employee wants to count the number of books\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating Flask and SQLAlchemy elements, you can ensure that your projects align with College Board requirements and demonstrate the effective use of databases in programming."

    "\n",
    "In this blog, we have explored the basics of using SQLAlchemy with Flask to interact with a SQLite database. We covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setting up Flask and SQLAlchemy\n",
    "- Defining models and creating tables\n",
    "- Adding initial data to the database\n",
    "- Querying the database to check for credentials\n",
    "- Creating new records in the database\n",
    "- Reading data from the database\n",

    "### Hacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review CRUD Operations through Scripts**: Analyze the provided scripts to understand their functionality. You will need to use db_init.py, others if you wish to preserve data between updates.\n",
    "    - Look at `db_backup.py`\n",
    "    - Look at `db_init.py`\n",
    "    - Look at `db_restore.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Build your own Table**: This is the small step to transition from using static data structures to dynamic database tables.  First you will need a table.\n",
    "    - Using model/user.py as an example, build your own table.  \n",
    "        - Try to build table with same columns / keys as you used on your RESTful API with static data.\n",
    "        - Be sure to initialize some data as shown in mode/user.py\n",
    "        - Observe results by opening the db file"
