    "- [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree) are a type of model used for both classification and regression. They work by creating a tree-like model of decisions based on the features. For example, in the context of the Titanic dataset, a Decision Tree might make decisions based on features like 'age', 'sex', and 'fare' to predict whether a passenger survived. The tree might first split by 'sex', then for each sex, split by 'age', and so on, creating a tree of decisions.\n",

It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific class (e.g., whether a passenger survived in the Titanic dataset). Logistic Regression applies a weighted sum of input features (which are often scaled between 0 and 1 for better performance) and passes the result through a sigmoid function to produce a probability between 0 and 1. The model then uses a threshold (typically 0.5) to classify the input into one of two categories. The sigmoid function is used to convert the weighted sum of input features into a probability score.\n",
