    "\n",
    "When making an HTTP request using JavaScript's fetch method, several layers of the networking stack come into play. This blog applies to CSA (Computer Science \"A\") and CSP (Computer Science Principles) projects. The content applies to our application(s) setup, with GitHub Pages interacting with a backend Python or Java web application on AWS EC2.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Tools in Use***\n",
    "- ***Docker:*** Encapsulates the backend application for consistent deployment across environments.\n",
    "- ***Nginx:*** Manages TCP/IP traffic, load balancing, and routing to backend containers.\n",
    "- ***Certbot:*** Secures communication by managing SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.\n",
    "- ***SQL Database:*** Stores and retrieves data for CRUD operations.\n",
    "- ***JavaScript Fetch and Promise Handling:*** Enables asynchronous HTTP requests from the GitHub Pages frontend to the backend.\n",
    "- ***Python Flask API (RESTful):*** Provides the backend framework for handling HTTP requests, defining routes, and interacting with the database.\n",
    "- ***Java Spring API (RESTful):*** Similarly provides backend framework for HTTP requests."

    "The Application Layer is responsible for providing network services directly to end-user applications. It facilitates communication between software applications and the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frontend (GitHub Pages)\n",
    "The frontend uses fetch to make HTTP(S) requests to the backend. The domain name of the backend hosted on AWS EC2 is resolved to an IP address using DNS (Domain Name System). The HTTP request is formatted, specifying the method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, and optional body (e.g., JSON payloads for CRUD operations).\n",

    "#### Backend (AWS EC2 with Docker)\n",
    "The backend application, running inside Docker containers, processes the request. For database operations:\n",
    "- **Create**: Inserts new records into the SQL database.\n",
    "- **Read**: Queries data.\n",
    "- **Update**: Modifies existing records.\n",
    "- **Delete**: Removes records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend constructs an HTTP response with a status code, headers, and an optional response body (e.g., JSON data).\n",
