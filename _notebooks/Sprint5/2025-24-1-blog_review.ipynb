    "Intro Requests for Review:\n",
    "Our group's program is a collaborative drawing game similar to Skribbl.io. It allows multiple users to join a game room, take turns drawing a given word, and have others guess the word based on the drawing. This fosters creativity, teamwork, and fun.\n",
    "My specific task is to implement the drawing pad feature. This feature allows users to draw on a canvas using various tools (e.g., pen, eraser, color picker) and have their drawings broadcasted in real-time to other players in the game room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input/Output Requests:\n",
    "Demo ways to Input to your full stack feature\n",
    "Frontend: Users interact with the drawing pad using mouse or touch inputs to draw on the canvas.\n",
    "Backend: The drawing data (coordinates, color, tool type) is sent to the server via WebSocket or REST API.\n",
    "PI Request: When a user draws, the frontend sends the drawing data to the server.\n",
    "API Response: The server broadcasts the drawing data to all connected clients, updating their canvases in real-time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Call to Algorithm Request: \n",
    "The fetch function sends a POST request to the /api/draw endpoint with the drawing data in the request body.\n",
    "The response is parsed as JSON and logged to the console. The data can be used to update the UI or handle errors.\n",
    "By changing the drawing data or the request method, the server can return different responses based on the validity and type of the request.\n",
