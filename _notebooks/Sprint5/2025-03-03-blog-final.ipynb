    "- The first thing I did was the drawing board, which allows users to be creative with whatever they draw to put on the gallery posts page. It has an eraser tool, marker, a variety of colors, undo and reset, and save drawing as a png. This was the first idea I created because our game is similar to skribbl.io where a user makes a drawing and people guess what the drawing is in a certain amount of time to receive points. "
