    "### Ways to Personally Study for the AP CSP Test:\n",
    "1. MCQ (Multiple Choice Practice Exams)\n",
    "- I can retake questions I missed and explain why my answers are either incorrect or correct\n",
    "- I will compare scores between the 3 MCQs I took and see what topics I need to improve on\n",
    "- I can practice timing myself and pacing better for the real exam\n",
    "\n",
    "2. FRQ (Wrriten Response Practice)\n",
    "- I can practice writing full responses to prompts on AP Classroom\n",
    "- I should focus on the Big Ideas such as Algorithms or Data\n",
    "- Know that I need to explain my thought process thoroughly and have to hit every point on the rubric to do well\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Big Ideas/AP Daily Videos\n",
    "- On AP Classroom there are some videos such as on Binary, Conditionals and other topics I can rewatch\n",
    "- I will take notes on those videos\n",
    "- I will quiz myself on the topics\n",
    "- I will make sure to also use the notes and HW/Popcorn Hacks I took when we were taught the lessons\n",
    "- The notes I took on them will be very useful for remembering the important topics for the AP exams\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Vocab & Textbook Notes\n",
    "- I will make a cheat sheet of notes on vocab\n",
    "- I will write definitions and have examples for each\n",
    "- I can make flashcards either digital or physical and will memorize the topics\n",
    "\n",
    "5. AP Exam On-Demand Reviews & Scoring\n",
    "- I will use the AP Exam Review Sessions\n",
    "- These sessions are good for practice and I can compare them to my FRQ answers\n",
    "- Also need to practice scoring sample responses/find what will get me all the points by patterns or study strategies\n"

    "### Scoring and Reflection\n",
    "- I scored a 62/70 on the MCQ which is my best yet out of the other 2 which I had scored a 56/66 and 51/67 on\n",
    "- I also had timed myself much better on this one doing it in 1:37:29 which was a question answered on average in 1:30 which is much better pacing than my other tests\n",
    "- Overall some of the skills I could have improved on looking at this were Random Values, Identifying & Correcting Errors, and Conditionals/Lists where I got most of my answers incorrect\n",
    "- By getting 8 questions wrong from these there is improvement as other questions I could have done better on and overall my skillset in these areas can be heavily improved \n",
    "- My strongest topics of Collaboration where I got 82% out of 11 questions and 100% out of 9 on Safe Computing I am very confident on which will help for the AP exam\n",
    "- Below I will show the problems I got wrong and how to fix them and identify why I was incorrect on them\n",
