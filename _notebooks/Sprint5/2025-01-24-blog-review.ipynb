    "## Intro Requests for Review:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group's program is a collaborative drawing game similar to Skribbl.io. The game lets multiple users join a room, where they take turns drawing a word, and other players guess the word based on the drawing. This process promotes creativity, teamwork, and interaction among users. My specific contribution is the implementation of the **drawing pad feature**, which allows users to draw on a canvas, save their drawings, and interact with others in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Your Group's Program:\n",
    "The overall aim of our game is to foster a fun, creative environment where users can both express themselves artistically and guess the artwork of others. By integrating a drawing pad feature, users can engage with the game actively, producing drawings that are then guessed by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Your Individual Feature:\n",
    "My task involves building the **drawing board** where users can draw and create. The drawing board allows users to select colors, adjust brush sizes, erase strokes, and save their creations. These features work seamlessly with the backend to store and retrieve drawings in real-time.\n",

    "## Input/Output Requests:\n",

    "### Demo Ways to Input to Your Full-Stack Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frontend:\n",
    "Users interact with the drawing pad by using their mouse or touchpad. They can draw freely on a canvas, which responds to their movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backend:\n",
    "Once a user draws, the drawing data (including position, color, and brush size) is sent to the backend via WebSocket or REST API, ensuring that their drawing is saved and shared with others in the game room.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Request (Frontend to Backend):\n",
    "When a user draws, the frontend sends the drawing data to the backend, like so:"

    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "This blog demonstrates how to implement a collaborative drawing feature in a full-stack game. By utilizing a backend API to handle drawing data, storing that data in a database, and implementing CRUD operations, the drawing pad feature becomes a fully interactive and integral part of the game. This approach ensures that user drawings are saved and accessible to all players in real time, fostering creativity and teamwork in the game."
